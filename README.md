# LeetCode Wasted Screen

## Why?

Let's be honest, seeing "Wrong Answer" or "Time Limit Exceeded" can be frustrating. This simple browser extension transforms that moment of disappointment into a moment of dark, cinematic humor, helping you laugh off a failed submission and get right back to coding.

## Features

-   **Cinematic Failure:** The entire page fades to a high-contrast grayscale upon failure.
-   **Iconic Overlay:** The classic bold, white "WASTED" text appears front and center.
-   **Authentic Sound:** The mournful "wasted" sound effect plays to complete the experience.
-   **Universal Detection:** Works for all common failure types:
    -   Wrong Answer
    -   Time Limit Exceeded
    -   Memory Limit Exceeded
    -   Runtime Error
    -   Compile Error
-   **Supports "Run" and "Submit":** Triggers on test case runs in the console as well as final submissions.
-   **Clean & Temporary:** The effect lasts for 4 seconds and then completely disappears, letting you get back to work.
-   **SPA-Aware:** Intelligently handles LeetCode's single-page application navigation, cleaning up the effect immediately if you navigate to a new page.

## How It Works (For the Curious)

This is a simple but effective extension that uses a few key browser APIs:

-   **`manifest.json`**: This is the blueprint of the extension, telling Chrome which files to use and what permissions it needs.
-   **Content Script (`content.js`)**: This is the core logic. It's injected directly into LeetCode problem pages.
    -   **`MutationObserver`**: A "spy" that watches the LeetCode page for changes. When it detects that a result (like "Wrong Answer") has been added to the page, it triggers the effect.
    -   **Audio Handling**: It handles the browser's autoplay policy by "unlocking" the audio context on the user's first click, ensuring the sound can play when needed.
    -   **Navigation Handling**: A `setInterval` checks for URL changes to clean up the effect instantly if the user navigates away, which is necessary for Single Page Applications like LeetCode.
-   **CSS (`style.css`)**: This file contains the visual styles for the grayscale filter (`filter: grayscale(...)`), the overlay, and the "WASTED" text (styled with `text-shadow` to create the iconic outline).
